# 🌟 Stellar Uzima - Decentralized Medical Records on Stellar using Soroban

Stellar Uzima is a decentralized smart contract system for secure, encrypted, and role-based management of medical records on the Stellar blockchain using Soroban and Rust. The project is designed to respect both modern and traditional medical practices, allowing metadata support for indigenous healing records.

## ✨ Features

- 📁 Encrypted on-chain medical records storage
- 🔐 Role-based access control (patients, doctors, admins)
- ⏱ Immutable timestamping and full history tracking
- 📜 Integration of traditional healing metadata
- 🔑 Public key-based identity verification
- ⚙️ Fully testable, modular, and CI-enabled
- 📦 Gas-efficient contract design

---

## 🧠 Architecture

The smart contract uses the Stellar Soroban framework written in Rust. Roles (doctor, patient, admin) are associated with public keys and permissions are enforced at the smart contract level.

All medical records are encrypted off-chain and stored with associated metadata on-chain:
- Patient ID
- Doctor ID
- Timestamp
- Encrypted data reference (IPFS hash or similar)
- Optional: Traditional treatment metadata (tags, category)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/)
- [Soroban CLI](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/getting-started/installation)
- Git

### 🛠 Project Initialization

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/your-org/stellar-uzima-contract.git
cd stellar-uzima-contract

# Install dependencies
rustup update
cargo build
````

---

### 🌐 Running a Local Testnet

To interact with your smart contract locally:

```bash
soroban local network start
```

To deploy the contract:

```bash
soroban contract deploy --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/*.wasm --network local
```

---

## 📜 Smart Contract Structure

### Roles

* **Patient**: Can view their own records
* **Doctor**: Can write and view records of their patients
* **Admin**: Can manage user roles

### Core Methods

| Method                | Description                         | Role Required  |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------- |
| `write_record`        | Adds a new encrypted medical record | Doctor         |
| `read_record`         | Retrieves a specific patient record | Doctor/Patient |
| `get_history`         | Retrieves all records for a patient | Authorized     |
| `assign_role`         | Assigns role to a public key        | Admin          |
| `add_traditional_tag` | Adds cultural metadata to a record  | Doctor         |

---

## 🧪 Testing

To run unit and integration tests:

```bash
cargo test
```

Tests are located in the `/tests/` folder and include:

* Role validation
* Record write and read
* Permission boundaries
* Record history tracking

---

## 🧰 Scripts

The `/scripts` folder includes test helpers for deploying and interacting with the contract using Soroban CLI. Example:

```bash
cargo run --bin deploy_contract
```

> See script headers for usage documentation.

---

## 📦 Deployment

To deploy on Stellar Futurenet:

1. Ensure `soroban` CLI is configured for Futurenet
2. Compile contract to WASM:

   ```bash
   cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
   ```
3. Deploy:

   ```bash
   soroban contract deploy --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/*.wasm --network futurenet
   ```
